            20 minutes of jazz and 20 minutes of tumbling. These classes are great for beginners or those who are ready to move up from our Mini Star classes.</h2>
        <h1>RECITAL</h1>
        <h2>Recitals are a large part of the dance education process. For the dancer to dance center stage in front of hundreds of people,
            is a huge milestone and a crucial step in building confidence. The Jazz'n Place dance studio holds 2 recitals a year.</h2>
