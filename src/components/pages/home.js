          “The Jazz’n Place is a business that is run on integrity and honesty. My daughter danced at the Jazz’n Place for 14 years, 
          the education she has received has opened up many opportunities for her. Some include Hannah Montana’s 3D movie,
          featured dancer in High School Musical 3, and Synergy Dance Company! The Jazz’n Place has been an asset in our lives 
          and is an asset to the community.”

        “I have 2 girls that dance at this studio. One daughter has been there almost 9 years and the other one 7 years. 
        I LOVE IT!!! We started as once a week and then comp team. Having my girls try out for competition team was the best 
        thing I did for them. They have both grown leaps and bounds. The teachers here are amazing. They push them, expect a 
        lot out of them, yet love them and believe in them. I love the time they take to correct and teach my girls. I love watching them 
        learn and grow. Chelsey the owner is amazing and always willing to listen to any concerns I have ever had. She loves these girls
        and pours her heart and soul into this studio and its success. The office staff is wonderful and always there to keep me organized,
          on track, and answer any questions. The studio itself is awesome. I have stayed at this studio and been loyal to it since my girls 
          were each 3 because it has so much to offer and continues to help my girls become the dancers they want to be and for that I’m forever 
          grateful.”
